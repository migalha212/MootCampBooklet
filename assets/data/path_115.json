    "story": "In a village hidden among green hills and crossed by a river with crystal-clear water, The Festival of Apples and Drums took place every year. This event was eagerly awaited, as it not only brought the locals together, but also the Zíngaros from the colourful caravans, who arrived from all over with their mysterious stories and songs. This year, however, something felt off While preparations were in full swing and the villagers were picking the best apples from the orchards to decorate the village, the zingaros brought a story of a secret lost on the banks of the river. They said that there, at midnight, the drums would echo by themselves, leading whomever heard them to the exact place where the treasure would be kept. On the night of the festival, amid dancing and laughter, the most curious gathered by the river. The apples glistened under the light of the torches and the drums rested, waiting for their time. At midnight, a low, rhythmic sound rose up, as if the river itself was beating to the sound of the drums. Following the sound, the villagers discovered, near the bank, an old chest covered in stones and moss. When they opened it, they found forgotten necklaces and ornaments, but also a note from their ancestors: ‘The real treasure is your union.’ Since then, the Festival of Apples and Drums has not only been a moment of celebration, but also a reminder that friendship and unity were the real riches of the village.",
