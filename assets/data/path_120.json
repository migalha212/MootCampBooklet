    "story": "On the Great Day of the Zigaros’ Procession, the hills awaken before the sun, trembling to the dry beat of bass drums that make the ground pulse like a living heart. Trails of dust rise behind colorful caravans as the Zigaros march: flaming banners wave and ancient chants echo through the valleys. Baskets of shining apples hang from carved poles, their wild scent promising plenty. By the clear river, apple trees form a natural gate—branches weave shadows on the water, inviting travelers into a forgotten legend. Yet the Zigaros came for more than  a celebration. Their procession is an ancient ritual that calls forth old memories and hints at a hidden treasure whispered by ancestors—but what is its true form? Gold? Jewels? No one knows. Some say it’s something immaterial, born from genuine bonds: giving an apple to the needy, offering a shoulder to a friend, singing together under the moon. If you listen closely, you’ll hear subtle shifts in the drums’ rhythm, urging you toward acts of unity. As twilight deepens and the sky turns orange, the procession follows winding paths, guided by haunting chants that awaken the hills’ strength. In a moment of hushed wonder, you feel the promise of that treasure—not a prize to hold, but a spark kindled in united hearts. And you—do you dare join this procession and uncover what the hills guard in silence?",
